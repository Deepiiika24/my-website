27 quality tests and 5 stage purification process â€“ for 100% purity every time. Coconut oil is known for its versatile benefits, particularly for skin, hair, and overall health. Rich in medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), it can boost metabolism and support weight management. Its antimicrobial properties make it effective for improving skin conditions, promoting hair growth, and supporting oral health through oil pulling. Additionally, it may help raise HDL (good cholesterol), potentially improving heart health when used in moderation. With its high smoke point, coconut oil is also a stable option for cooking, adding a mild coconut flavor to dishes.</p>
